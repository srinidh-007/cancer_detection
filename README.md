# Cancer Detection 

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society. 
The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. 
Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages
in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the
methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modeling.

## In our project we are going to use Iterative Dichotomizer(ID3) Decision Tree algorithm to predict Breast Cancer.

### Features that we have in our project Breast Cancer data set:-
* Cl.thickness
* Cell.size
* Cell.shape
* Marg.adhesion
* Epith.c.size
* Bare.nuclei
* Bl.cromatin
* Normal.nucleoli
* Mitoses
